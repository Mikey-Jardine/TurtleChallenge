# TurtleChallenge
A turtle must walk through a minefield
The inputs are read from the txt files "moves.txt" and "game-settings.txt". 
"moves.txt" is just a comma delimited list of 'r' and 'm'.
"game-settings.txt" is JSON formatted and serialized to an object for the game.
I decided to use .txt files as it is a simple format.
Outputs are logged to console for every move and outcome of the game.
The board size is read from the "game-settings.txt" so the size can vary per game.
